# ‚ú® Features
Well the features are some basic features you would find in a movie/series website!

# ‚ö°Ô∏è Quick start
- After you clone the repository:

```
npm i
ng build #to build the project;  The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
ng serve # for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. 
```

# üí° Fun fact
I've made a website which uses AI to help you suggest you movies [The Movie Suggestor](https://the-movie-app-tawny.vercel.app/sign-in). So you can look up movies from that website on this website for more information about them. Isn't that cool?

# ‚ùì Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.
